# Lagrange-Interpolation-and-Richardson
Implementation of lagrange interpolation and Richardson extrapolation for the derivative

The files horner.c, puntsfit.c and inter1.c resolve the interpolation problem with a lineal system using gauss.c (an implementation of gauss algorithm)

The files didi.c, hornernewton.c and internew.c resolve the interpolation problem with the divided differences method, more optimal respect the linear one

Finally, the files derivar.c, f1.c, increment.c and richardson.c implement the Richardson extrapolation algorithm applied to the derivative (first or second order)
